To set up your environment, we'll create a virtual Python 3.7 environment and then run the setup scripts to install the dependencies.


If you have Anaconda, you can set up an environment with:
```bash
$ bash setup-conda-env.sh
$ source activate risecamp
```

If you are not using Anaconda, you can setup a `virtualenv` with:
```bash
$ bash setup-virtualenv.sh
$ source activate risecamp
```


You can also install the dependencies directly with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Just make sure you are using Python 3.7 or greater.
